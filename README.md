# SofwareProject-BreathEase
BreathEase is an AI-powered mental wellness and digital well-being application designed to help users manage stress, anxiety, and unhealthy screen habits. The app continuously monitors screen time, app usage, and late-night activity to identify harmful digital behavior. Based on these patterns, it provides real-time smart alerts, personalized recommendations, and supportive guidance to help users build healthier routines. BreathEase also includes a complete wellness toolkit featuring breathing exercises, yoga sessions, calming music, mood tracking, and digital journaling. Users can anonymously connect with licensed therapists through secure chat or calls, and the built-in crisis detection system offers immediate support during emotional distress. Developed using the Scrum Agile model, the project includes full SRS documentation, UI/UX design, Git workflow, estimation, risk management, and test cases to ensure a stable, user-friendly, and reliable mental health companion.
